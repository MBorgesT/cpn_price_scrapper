# Supermarket Price Scraper for Canned Fish Prices

This software was developed with the intention to provide a quick insight into the current prices of same category products that Conservas Portugal Norte produces in the different markets they sell to, with those being Portugal, Israel, Hong Kong and Macau. It works by having "catalog" files, which provide the required website information for the program to be able to scrap the intended data, using Selenium to simulate user navigation and BeautifulSoup to extract information from the resulting page source.

# How to use?
